<b>Project Descreption
  
This project is an automation for Search Ads 360 data reporting.  The scripts efficiently automates the extraction, tranformation & load process.
The data extraction script eliminates the need for manual report download, saving time through automating a monthly report data pull. The next module of the project transforms the downloaded report.  It focuses on formating the data types, rearranging and renaming the columns for database compatability.
The final module, the data load, automates the import to the AWS s3 bucket (the data lake).  The data is then easily accessible for Tableau reporting dashboards
